# Latent-Variable-Model-for-Low-Light-Enhancement

Problem Statement

Low-light images often suffer from poor visibility, high noise, and loss of detail, making them difficult for both human viewing and computer vision algorithms. Traditional enhancement techniques (like histogram equalization) fail to adapt to varying illumination conditions.
In this project, we aim to use a Latent Variable Model (Variational Autoencoder) to learn the hidden illumination and reflectance components of low-light images. By reconstructing images through their latent features, the model can enhance brightness and preserve natural details, serving as an initial learning-based step toward our final hybrid low-light enhancement pipeline.
